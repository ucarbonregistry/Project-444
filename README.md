The project activity involves 5 MW bagasse fuelled green power supply to grid. The project is
developed by Balrampur Chini Mills Limited. Location of the project activity is in Village Maizapur,
Tehsil Colonelganj, District Gonda, State Uttar Pradesh, and Country India.

The project activity involves generation of both thermal and electrical energy from the combustion
of renewable biomass i.e. bagasse, to generate process steam and electricity for captive consumption
and grid supply. The technology employed is a biomass-based cogeneration system, i.e., generating
steam and electricity. Thus, the technology to be used in this project is environmentally safe & sound.
Emission reductions will be claimed for electricity exported to the grid only, hence ACM0006 is applicable.

Maizapur Chini Mills is a unit of Balrampur Chini Mills Limited., located in Maizapur village of
Gonda district, Uttar Pradesh. Plant has installed two biomass fired boilers of capacities 35 TPH each.
The boilers are connected with a common steam header and together connected to two turbines, of
capacity 5.085 MW each. The cogeneration facility generates steam for both process needs and
meeting the electricity requirements of the plant. After meeting the in-house demand of electricity,
surplus electricity is exported to the grid. The state discom, Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited
(UPPCL) has signed a PPAon 20/11/2020 for 5 MW power supply. The purpose of the project activity
is to provide renewable electricity to the grid, thereby increasing the percentage of renewable energy
in the present grid mix.

In absence of the project activity, equivalent amount of electricity which is supplied by this project
activity would have been supplied to the grid by predominantly fossil fuel based power plant(s)
connected to this grid. The plant commissioning date is 24/12/2021. Hence start date of the crediting
period is also considered from 24/12/2021.

Thus the project activity would replace the fossil fuel dominated electricity with green electricity,
which would have otherwise been supplied by the fossil fuel dominated thermal power plant
connected to the grid. Biomass is a renewable source of energy and also considered as carbon neutral.
In the project activity the preferred biomass is bagasse. The industry being a sugar mill and bagasse
being its own process waste, CoUs shall only be claimed for the quantity of electricity exported to
the grid. Hence the project activity is expected to reduce the anthropogenic Greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions by 17,496 tCO2e/year.
